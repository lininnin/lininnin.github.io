 <p style>The British Shorthair is the pedigreed version of the traditional British domestic cat, with a distinctively stocky body, thick coat, and broad face. The most familiar colour variant is the "British Blue", with a solid grey-blue coat, pineapple eyes, and a medium-sized tail. The breed has also been developed in a wide range of other colours and patterns, including tabby and colourpoint.</p>

<h3>Appearence</h3>
<p>The British Shorthair is a relatively powerful-looking large cat, having a broad chest, strong thick-set legs with rounded paws and a medium-length, blunt-tipped tail. The head is relatively large and rounded, with a short muzzle, broad cheeks (most noticeable in mature males, who tend to develop prominent jowls) and large round eyes that are deep coppery orange in the British Blue and otherwise vary in colour depending on the coat. Their large ears are broad and widely set.</p>

    <h5>The blue coat is often described as “smoky” or “ashy” and is one of the most sought-after colors in the breed. It’s also one of the most genetically recessive, which means that not all cats carrying the gene will express it fully. This can result in cats with a lighter coat or even partial blue coloring.</h5>

    <h5>Silver shaded British Shorthair kittens, also known as Chinchillas are striking. The silver shaded British Shorthair is a very unique cat. They have a bright white coat, with just the absolute tips of each fur being coloured. This creates a shimmering, glittering effect as they walk. And then there are the eyes: vivid green, lined in black eyeliner and framed by a beautiful white face with nothing but the faintest of tabby markings ghosting through.</h5></div>
